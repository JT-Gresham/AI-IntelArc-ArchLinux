# Features
Features installers and creates launchers for:
*    Ollama (python) -- WORKING
*    Fooocus         -- WIP
*    CrewAI          -- WIP
*    Automatic1111   -- WIP
  
# REQUIREMENTS
This framework assumes that you have these already installed:
*    The latest Intel Arc GPU drivers
*    Python 3.11 (can be found in the AUR as 'python311')
  
# Installation Is Easy
Simply run the installation bash file (ex: AIIAAL-install.sh, AIIAAL-install-ollama.sh, etc...) for the package you want to install.  Yeah...it's that easy!
*    Note: AIIAAL needs to be already installed otherwise the other installers won't work. AIIAAL is the framework the others are built on and you only need to install the framework (AIIAAL) once.
