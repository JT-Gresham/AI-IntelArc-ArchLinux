# Features
Features installers and creates launchers for:
*    Ollama + Open WebUI   -- WORKING
*    Fooocus               -- WIP
*    CrewAI                -- WIP
*    Automatic1111         -- WIP
  
# REQUIREMENTS
This framework assumes that you have these already installed:
*    Arch Linux based OS - Duh...
*    Intel Arc GPU - Duh...
*    The latest Intel Arc GPU drivers
*    Python 3.11 (can be found in the AUR as 'python311')
  
# Installation Is Easy
Simply run the installation bash file (ex: AIIAAL-install.sh, AIIAAL-install-ollama.sh, etc...) for the package you want to install.  Yeah...it's that easy!
*    Note: AIIAAL needs to be already installed otherwise the other installers won't work. AIIAAL is the framework the others are built on and you only need to install the framework (AIIAAL) once.
